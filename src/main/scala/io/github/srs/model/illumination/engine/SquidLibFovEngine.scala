   *   The y-coordinate of the light source in cell space.

   *   The maximum distance (in cells) to propagate the light.
   * @return
   *   A row-major (x-fast) flattened ArraySeq of doubles in the range [0,1], representing the light intensity at each
   *   cell. The size equals width Ã— height of the grid.
