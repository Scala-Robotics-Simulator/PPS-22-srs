A robotics simulator written in Scala.

## About

The goal of this project is to create a simple and extensible robotics simulator.

In the simulator, users can create robots, obstacles and lights in a 2D environment. And see how the robots interact with the environment and each other based on their behavior and sensors.

## Getting Started

You can find the latest release of the simulator on the [releases page](https://github.com/Scala-Robotics-Simulator/PPS-22-srs/releases).

You can run the simulator by downloading the latest release and running the `PPS-22-srs.jar` file with the following command:

```bash
java -jar PPS-22-srs.jar
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [PPS-22-srs doc](https://scala-robotics-simulator.github.io/PPS-22-srs/).
